Image compression is an important process in computing which allows the storage of more images on disk and transfer optimisation over the internet without diminishing the overall quality of an image. For this assignment, an application was developed in Java and implemented a custom modification to an existing compression algorithm known as ‘run-length-encoding’.

The modification to the algorithm allowed a user to select a ‘constant’ which specified a fixed range permissible between the pixel values and thus compressing similar colours rather than exact values. Compression statistics on several sample images with a varying ‘compression constant’ was tested and recorded. It was found that a higher constant meant greater compression ratio but diminished the quality at a low-level whereas viewed normally the quality was still satisfactory to the human eye.
